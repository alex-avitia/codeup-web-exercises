//~ * Map * ~

//TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

//var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4 , 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9, 10];
//
// var numbersAddOne = [];
//
// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
//     numbersAddOne.push(numbers[i] + 1);
// }
//
// console.log(numbersAddOne);

//TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

// let numbersAddOneMap = numbers.map(function(num){
//     return num + 1;
// })
//
// console.log(numbersAddOneMap);

//TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!

// geocode("15900 La Cantera Pkwy Ste 21200, San Antonio, TX 78256", mapboxToken).then(function(results){
//     console.log("Whiskey Cake");
//     marcoMap.setCenter(results);
// })
// geocode("2154 Austin Hwy, San Antonio, TX 78218", mapboxToken).then(function(results){
//     console.log("Arirang Korean Food");
//     marcoMap.setCenter(results);
// })
// geocode("68910 Bandera Rd #305, San Antonio, TX 78250", mapboxToken).then(function(results){
//     console.log("Smashin' Crab");
//     marcoMap.setCenter(results);
// })

let restaurants = [
    {
        name: 'Whiskey Cake',
        address: '15900 La Cantera Pkwy Ste 21200, San Antonio, TX 78256',
        features: 'good cocktails'
    },
    {
        name: 'Arirang',
        address: '2154 Austin Hwy, San Antonio, TX 78218',
        features: 'authentic Korean'
    },
    {
        name: 'India Palace',
        address: '123 IdkWay',
        features: 'buffet'
    }
];

let nameList = restaurants.map(function(restaurant){
    return restaurant.name;
})

console.log(nameList);

//TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins



//TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins

//~ * Filter * ~

//TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)

//TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4 , 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9, 10];

let evens = numbers.filter(function(num){
    return num % 2 === 0;
});


console.log(evens);

//TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants

let hasBuffet = restaurants.filter(function(restaurant){
   return restaurant.features.includes("buffet");
});

console.log(hasBuffet);

//TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!

//testing for names shorter than 8 characters

//TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!

let shortNames = restaurants.filter(function(restaurant){
    let nameLength = restaurant.name.length;
    return nameLength < 8;
})

console.log(shortNames);

//~ * Reduce * ~

//Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

//TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!

let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let sum = nums.reduce(function(total, num){
    return total + num;
}, 0)

console.log('Our total is ' + sum);

//TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.

let stringArr = ["Codeup", "San", "Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco", "Cohort", "ES6"];

let strLengthObj = stringArr.reduce(function(object, element){
    object[element] = element.length; //assign the length as a value of the property named element {elementName: elementLength}
    return object;
}, {})

console.log(strLengthObj);

//TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!

function countWords(sentence) {
    const words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words
     // start with an empty object
    return words.reduce((wordCounts, word) => {
        if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
            // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
            wordCounts[word] = 1;
        } else {
            // otherwise increment the existing count
            wordCounts[word] += 1;
        }
        return wordCounts;
    }, {});
}

countWords('Mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb');
// {Mary: 1, had: 1, a: 1, little: 3, lamb: 3}

//TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).

let familyTree = [
    {
        name: "Jennifer Avitia",
        age: 47
    },
    {
        name: "Marston Cotten",
        age: 49
    },
    {
        name: "Denise Fuller",
        age: 51
    }
]

const totalAge = familyTree.reduce(function(total, familyTree){
    return total + familyTree.age;
}, 0)

console.log(totalAge);
